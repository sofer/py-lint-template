 # <PROJECT_NAME>

 A short description of what this project does and who it's for.

## Template Overview
This repository is a template for new Python projects, pre-configured with code formatting, linting, static typing, security scanning, testing, and a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. Use this template to kickstart your project with sensible defaults and best practices baked in.

## How to Use This Template
1. On GitHub, click the “Use this template” button to create your own repository.
2. Clone your new repository locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_ORG>/<YOUR_REPO>.git
   cd <YOUR_REPO>
   ```
3. Replace all placeholder values (`<PROJECT_NAME>`, `<GH_ORG>`, `<Your Name>`, etc.) in:
   - `pyproject.toml` (project metadata & dependencies)
   - `README.md` (title, badge URL, URLs)
   - CI workflow badge URL in this README
4. Create your package directory (e.g., `src/<project_name>`) and add your code.
5. Install dev dependencies and set up pre-commit hooks:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -e .[dev]
   pre-commit install --install-hooks
   ```
6. Use the provided Makefile or `pre-commit run --all-files` to ensure code quality locally.

 ## Getting Started

 ### Prerequisites
 - Python 3.8+
 - Git

 ### Installation
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/<GH_ORG>/<PROJECT_NAME>.git
 cd <PROJECT_NAME>
 python -m venv .venv
 source .venv/bin/activate
 pip install --upgrade pip
 pip install -e .[dev]
 pre-commit install --install-hooks
 ```

 ### Usage
 Use the provided Makefile to run common tasks:
 ```bash
 make format        # black + isort
 make lint          # flake8
 make typecheck     # mypy
 make security      # bandit + pip-audit
 make test          # pytest
 make coverage      # pytest + coverage report
 make pre-commit    # run all pre-commit hooks on all files
 ```
